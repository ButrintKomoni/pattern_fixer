# pattern_fixer
**## Pattern Fixer is a tool that makes your life easier when it comes to generating set of patterns, while you are playing around with buffer overflows.**



The idea of this tool came to me after the pattern_create module of msfconsole had a slow performance on generating patterns, and that a lot of people had issues with that specific module of msfconsole on different linux distros.


Usage:
pattern_create.py -l [The length that you want to generate the pattern]

TODO:
  add more functions into it, such as:
  pattern_offset
